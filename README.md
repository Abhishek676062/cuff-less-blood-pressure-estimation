# cuff-less-blood-pressure-estimation
This project aims to build a predictive model for a cuff-less blood pressure estimation device that uses machine learning to predict blood pressure based on PPG and ECG data. The model will take PPG and ECG data as input and predict the corresponding systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
